# The problem

If you are a heavy user of Grist, you may have used the "Attachment" feature.

And if you did, you probably noticed it's not straightforward to use the attachment elsewhere.

Don't worry, I have the solution for you


# The Solution

This repository contains multiple widgets depending on your use-case.

To install a custom widget, go read [the grist documentation on widget](https://support.getgrist.com/page-widgets/) and use "custom url" with the urls belows.

## View attachments in Grist

This widget shows a view of all attachments in your column.

Use this link: `https://rambip.github.io/grist-attachment-widgets/viewer`




## Generate urls in Grist

This widget generates links on the fly using the grist API. You can then use these links in a markdown or html template for exemple.

Use this link: `https://rambip.github.io/grist-attachment-widgets/url-generator`

⚠️ The generated links are temporary. You can't use them in external websites, see the next section for permanent links.

*Note: this will only generate the URL for the first attachment in the column*


## Generate URLs for external websites.

No need for custom widget for this one !

If you want to use your attachments on external websites, you need to:
1. Make your document public (otherwise other websites can't access your images)
2. Use this formula (replace `$Attachment` by the right column name): 

```
# extract url and document ID
url, end = SELF_HYPERLINK().split("/o/docs")
doc_id = end.split("/")[1]
# extract first attachment.
if not $Attachment:
    return None
attach_id = $Attachment.id[0]
# use API to provide attachment URL
return f"{url}/api/docs/{doc_id}/attachments/{attach_id}/download"
```

*Note: this will only generate the URL for the first attachment in the column*
